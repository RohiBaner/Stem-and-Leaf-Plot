# Stem and Leaf Plot
A stem and leaf plot can be constructed using the first digit of two-digit numbers or first two digits of three-digit numbers as the stem number and the remaining digits as the leaf number.

### Advantage of using Stem and Leaf Plot
- The plot can be constructed quickly using pencil and paper.
- The values of each individual data point can be recovered from the plot.
- The data is arranged compactly since the stem is not repeated in multiple data points.

### Code Details
- Implemented in Python3 without any libraries
- User can opt to upload data directly via the ```data.csv``` file or use a random integer generator.
- Direct output on console for easy viewing
